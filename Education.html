    <h3>KAFA Integrasi Masjid Proton</h3>
    <p>2006, I did begin pre-school at the age of five years in this religious school.
    As far as I remember, I learned the basics of Islam in this school, including how to read surahs and recognize the Jawi alphabet. 
    I only remained there for a year before moving on to other pre-school.</p>

    <h3>Sekolah Kebangsaan Seksyen 27 (1)</h3>
    <p>Afterwards when, I began my switchover from KAFA Integrasi Masjid Proton to Sekolah Kebangsaan Seksyen 27 (1). 
    This school is a primary school that provides pre-school training. I first went there when I was six years old, in 2007. 
    The teaching and learning process here is very enjoyable and exciting and includes singing and dancing. 
    I learned a lot here as well, and I learned the essentials of reading and writing.</p>

    <h3>Sekolah Kebangsaan Seksyen 27 (1)</h3>
    <p>In primary school, I started my schooling from 1st year to 6th year.
        This school was run in the morning session from 7:30 am until 1:30 pm.
        My encounter around this school has been extremely positive and enjoyable. 
        I have to take the <b><i>Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR)</i></b> until I reached grade 6, which is the final grade in primary school. 
        Alhamdulillah, thanks to efforts and prayers, I did obtain 4A 1B in the entire subject.</p>

    <h3>KAFA Integrasi As-Sakinah</h3>
    <p>I also attended to KAFA Integrasi As-Sakinah. This is a religious school that is typically conducted in the afternoon session. 
        This school is similar to my morning session school, where final year students will take an important examination in Selangor called the <b><i>Penilaian Sekolah Rendah Agama (PSRA)</i></b>. 
        Before taking the PSRA, Year 5 students must also take the <b><i>Ujian Penilaian Kelas KAFA (UPKK)</i></b>. 
        Again, thanks to Allah, I received straight 8A's in UPKK and <b><i>JayyidJiddan</i></b> in PSRA.</p>

    <h3>Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seksyen 27</h3>
    <p>Secondary school is the next higher level of education. 
        I attended to Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seksyen 27. 
        This school is right next to my elementary school. 
        Due to near vicinity, I only walk to school every day. 
        At this school, I did took the <b><i>Kelas Kemahiran Al-Quran (KKQ)</i></b> stream. 
        This means that I will have an additional subject, Arabic, from form 1 to form 5.</p>
    <p><b>2016</b> - I would have to take the <b><i>Pentaksiran Tingkatan 3 (PT3)</i></b> examination. 
        My exam results turned out to be quite satisfied, with as many as 4A 2B 2C 3D.</p>
    <p><b>2018</b> - My senior year of high school was in 2018. The <b><i>Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM)</i></b> is a major exam that will determine my life after school. 
        To be honest, that was a challenging year for me because I was swamped with extra classes and other responsibilities. 
        Alhamdulillah, I completed my schooling with 4A 2B 3C overall.</p>

      <h3>Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM)</h3>
      <p>In 2019, I continue my studies for a Diploma in Information Management at Universiti Teknologi MARA, Negeri Sembilan Branch, Rembau Campus.
        Over the 5 semesters, this course offers a variety of theory-based subjects as well as some practical. I was still a full-time student for two and a half years.
        To be sincere, this is not my preferred course, but I believe in the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon me, so I simply go with the ï¬‚ows given.</p>
      <p>In September 2019, I began my first semester with normal physical learning. To being honest, I am very enthusiastic to begin my life as an independent student.
        Alhamdulillah, thanks to God's grace, I was able to finish my first semester with good pointer result. That is what makes me even more eager to proceed for next semester.
        Sad to say, the world began hit by the Covid-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020. It has changed my various ways of life, including my studies.
        From 2020 to the current, I have been preparing myself to do online learning from home. Again, thanks to my efforts over three semesters of online learning, 
        I was able to maintain good semester results, by achieving a dean's award each semester.</p>
